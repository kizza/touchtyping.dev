# Touch Typing for Developers

I've been considering changing-up my keyboard game (*cough* ergodox)

This project is the result of wanting to pull together some of my favourite features from existing touch typing tools.

It's also quite fun to play around with react, hooks and serverless.

### Tech stack

- Create react app
- Lots of hooks and functional components
- Uses [Faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) to generate function bodies
- Deployed to aws via [serverless](https://github.com/serverless-components/website)

### Run online
